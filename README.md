A powerful Bash script to scan your local network for all connected devices. It intelligently identifies your machine's IP address and excludes it from the final results, giving you a clean list of other devices on your network.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **‚ú® Interactive Interface Selection:** A user-friendly `whiptail` menu lets you choose which network interface to scan.
*   **üéØ Multi-Tool Scanning:** Leverages `nmap`, `netdiscover`, and `nbtscan` for comprehensive and reliable device discovery.
*   **ü§ñ Smart Dependency Handling:** Automatically checks for required tools and prompts to install them if they're missing (on `apt`-based systems).
*   **üßπ Clean Output:** Excludes the IP of the scanning machine from the final list for clarity.
*   **üíª Pure Bash:** A lightweight and portable script for your Linux toolkit.

## ‚úÖ Compatibility

This script is designed for Debian-based Linux distributions that use the `apt` package manager. It has been tested and is known to be compatible with:

*   Debian
*   Ubuntu (and its flavors like Kubuntu, Xubuntu)
*   Linux Mint
*   ...and other Debian derivatives.

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies

The script requires the following command-line tools:

*   `nmap`
*   `netdiscover`
*   `whiptail`

If any of these dependencies are not found on your system, the script will automatically attempt to install them using `sudo apt install`.

## üöÄ Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LINUX-OASIS/NETWORKING-SCAN-NETWORK-EXCLUDE-NETIFACE-IP.git
    cd NETWORKING-SCAN-NETWORK-EXCLUDE-NETIFACE-IP
    ```

2.  **Make the script executable:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x custom-NETWORKING-SCAN-NETWORK-EXCLUDE-NETIFACE-IP.sh
    ```

3.  **Run the script with sudo:**
    `sudo` is required for dependency installation and for network scanning tools like `netdiscover` to function correctly.
    ```bash
    sudo ./custom-NETWORKING-SCAN-NETWORK-EXCLUDE-NETIFACE-IP.sh
    ```

4.  **Select your network interface** from the interactive menu and let the scan begin!
